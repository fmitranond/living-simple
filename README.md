# living-simple - training project
I have been teaching myself html/css for a while now and this is my first ever website I completed on my own.
learning how to create the layout for me at this time was more important than the content - forgive me.
I could have done it better in all areas, but one important area that I paid very little attention to was Acessibility.
I will do better next time.
