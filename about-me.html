                    <p>
                        <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                        but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it becauce there was too much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in,
                        and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                    </p>

                <div class="abt-me-content">
                    <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>
                        I literally put 90% of my pocession in the garbage, sold my apartment and moved to a smaller apartment,
                        and I quit my job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in a such a bad place,
                        I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="abt-me-content">
                    <h3>Now I live a simple life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                        I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With how much it turned my life around,
                        <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>
                        and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, whick is why I started this site!
